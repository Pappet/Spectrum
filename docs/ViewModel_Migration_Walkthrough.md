# ViewModel Migration Walkthrough

This document highlights the changes made to complete the `ViewModel` integration across the remaining screens of the application.

## 1. What Was Done

All pending screens identified in `vm-migration.md` have had their local state successfully hoisted into corresponding `AndroidViewModel` components. 

### A. ViewModels Built
- **InventoryViewModel**: Hoists the `searchQuery`, `kind` and `favOnly` filters, along with dialog states.
- **SecurityAuditViewModel**: Takes ownership of the audit's `report`, `auditPhase`, port and network lists. Furthermore, `runAudit()` logic alongside `DisposableEffect` (for cleaning up the Scanner states on detached views) is gracefully fully isolated and encapsulated from `SecurityAuditScreen`.
- **MapViewModel**: Exposes the `repository` and tracks the `selectedBssid` marker context.
- **OnboardingViewModel**: Manages the multi-step progress indices (`step`).
- **BluetoothViewModel (Updated)**: Extended to hold `openSvc` and `selChar` to support consistent `BleDetailScreen`/`GattDetailView` overlays without losing configuration instances on configuration spins! 

### B. Screens Refactored
Each screen has been adapted to take its newly minted `ViewModel` via `androidx.lifecycle.viewmodel.compose.viewModel()`:
- `InventoryScreen`
- `SecurityAuditScreen`
- `MapScreen`
- `OnboardingScreen` 
- `BluetoothScreen.kt` & `BleDetailScreen.kt` (Wired state back correctly into the shared instances) 

All usages of `remember { mutableStateOf(...) }` containing complex logic, external dependencies handling (scanners inside screens), and persistent user state across components have been replaced.

## 2. Testing Results
The app was successfully compiled locally via `./gradlew compileDebugKotlin` on the latest changes. All errors regarding local state mismatches were resolved and the Android code validates properly! 

## Next Steps
- Open the application, dive into multiple tabs, and test that interactions like filter usage (`InventoryScreen`), auditing workflows (`SecurityAudit`), or map selections (`MapScreen`) safely persist when you swap away into `BluetoothScreen` and then back!
